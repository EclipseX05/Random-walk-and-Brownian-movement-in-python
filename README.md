# Random-walk-and-Brownian-movement-in-python
 This project explores 1D and 2D random walks, featuring Brownian motion in Main.py.  For 1D walks, we tally 0 endings, simulating for accuracy, and compare averages to 1/(root of (pi * steps)).  In 2D, we compare final distances to sqrt(2), refining simulations for reliability.  Rushed and unreviewed due to time constraints.
