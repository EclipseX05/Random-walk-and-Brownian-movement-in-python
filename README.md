This school project consists of studying the random walk in 1 and 2 dimensions as well as displaying Brownian motion.
The main.py file includes all the other files.

The random walk in 1 dimension allows us to take the number of endings at position 0.
We can choose how many simulations to do in order to have a precise number of endings at 0 depending on the number of steps.
We will then check if the number of endings over 0 averaged corresponds to our statistical prediction which is: 1/(root of (pi * the number of steps)).

Concerning the random walk in 2 dimensions, we check if the final distance after a certain number of steps corresponds to our statistical prediction (square root of 2).
To do this, we can choose the number of simulations for each step in order to have more consistent and reliable data.

We can also display simple Brownian motion.

This project is shoddy and surely contains many errors. It was produced in a very short time and did not undergo any review.
